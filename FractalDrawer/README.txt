How to run
Use intellij or VSCode. Press the play or run button after downloading the .java files. Press the play button
while in the FractalDrawer class to run its main method. Input whether you would like to draw a triangle,
rectangle or circle fractal and press enter to run.
Assumes automatic compiling done by the IDE.


Additional features
I implemented helper functions to make random colors as my fractals all use random colors. 

Bugs
I think the rectangle drawing method works correctly. It draws a rectangle on each of the 4 sides. It looks
strange because the rectangles aren't drawn exactly even and centered on each side.
